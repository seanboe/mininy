# Minimy

I got bored towards the end of winter break and one of my friends wanted a blog, so I decided to make one for him from the ground up... aka without using any frameworks. All the posts are manually built using page layouts under the `/layouts/` folder by `build.py`. To add posts, make a markdown file under `/posts/` and include the correct frontmatter. The tags, tag pages, and everything else will be generated for your as static html files in `/dist/`. To deploy, just deploy the `/dist/` folder without any frameworks enabled!
